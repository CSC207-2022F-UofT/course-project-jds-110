# Project Information

## About the Game
Our project is a resource-management game based on a farm theme. The user can create an account that saves their farm information so they can come back to their farm whenever they want. The user carries the responsibility of a farmer, as they can buy and sell goods that they yield from their crops and animals. When the user chooses to progress to the next day, there's a chance of a random event happening that can either benefit or cause drawbacks for the user. Once the user reaches certain milestones for their farm, they win the game!

## How to Play
Press start at the title screen and enter your user information in the sign-in screen so the program retrieves your data if you have an exisitng account, or create a new account and farm for you. You will be brought to the main screen, which contains all the actions that you can do in the day. Once you are done with managing your farm for the day, you can go to the next day to progress.

## How to Start The Game
Run the FarmGame.java file.
