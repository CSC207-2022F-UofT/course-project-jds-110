# Project Information

## About the Game
Our project is a resource-management game based on a farm theme. The user can create an account that saves their farm information so they can come back to their farm whenever they want. The user carries the responsibility of a farmer, as they can buy and sell goods that they yield from their crops and animals. When the user chooses to progress to the next day, there's a chance of a random event happening that can either benefit or cause drawbacks for the user. Once the user reaches certain milestones for their farm, they win the game!

## How to Play
Press the "Start" button at the title screen and enter your user information in the sign-in screen so the program retrieves your data if you have an exisitng account, or create a new account and farm for you.
